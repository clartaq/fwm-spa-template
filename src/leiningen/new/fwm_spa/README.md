# fwm-spa

This is an example project for a [ClojureScript](https://www.clojurescript.org) for an [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io) and [figwheel-main](https://figwheel.org).

## Overview

This project was intended to serve as a learning experience in writing apps in ClojureScript using a [Clojure Deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) style project and [figwheel-main](https://figwheel.org). It reflects the way that I often start my own projects.

The project is inspired by the figwheel-main project template [here](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main-template). It contains some small changes to the way of doing things that I prefer in my own projects.

What it produces is a simple SPA using Reagent to display the current time in a browser with regular, periodic visual updates. It's a foolish but educational example. Maybe it's a good starting point for an app that you've been planning to write.

## Development Builds

Of course, you need Java and Clojure to get started. I used Java 11 and Clojure 1.10.1.

From a terminal window in the project directory, get an interactive development environment by running:

    clj -A:fig:repl

This will compile a development build, open a tab in the default browser at [`localhost:9500`](http://localhost:9500), and start a ClojureScript REPL in the terminal. Changes made to the ClojureScript portion of the project will be compiled and reloaded in real time. Changes affecting the browser display (Reagent components) will show up in the browser as well.

    clj -A:fig:dev

Similar to the above but does not open a REPL.

## Production Build

To build an optimized and minimized version, run:

    clj -A:fig:min

You can run the resulting program by loading `resources/public.index.html` in your browser. The index file will load and run the minimized `resources/public/main.js` file.


## Testing

To do one-time ClojureScript testing, run:

    clj -A:fig:test

Test results will show up in the terminal. A testing web page will be opened, but you can just close it after the tests have completed. Or you can look at some of the notes in `test.cljs.edn` for a few ways to run the tests headless if you prefer.

The project will also run automatic testing in the background when using the `-A:fig:repl` and `-A:fig:dev` aliases. Just open a browser tab at `http://localhost:9500/figwheel-extra-main/auto-testing` to see the results. The results will update shortly after any changes to the source files are saved.

## Other Aliases

To delete all compilation artifacts, use:

    clj -A:clean

To check for outdated dependencies, run:

    clj -A:ancient

## What it Does

The application itself is quite useless and silly. After loading up, the page will begin continually updating a display of the local time. It does so by asking for the system time every second then updating a Reagent atom with the new time. Changing the Reagent atom triggers the display change.

Congratulations! You have managed to turn your multiple hundred/thousand dollar system into a $10 clock.
